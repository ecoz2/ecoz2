# Just came across -funsafe-loop-optimizations (and -Wunsafe-loop-optimizations)
#    https://stackoverflow.com/a/20859128/830737
# which looked like an interesting option. I even tried it using gcc 9.3.0_1 on my mac
# (and with no complains from the compiler).
# But seems like the option was removed from gcc in general.
# (existed in gcc 4.4.3: https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.3.3/gcc/Optimize-Options.html).
